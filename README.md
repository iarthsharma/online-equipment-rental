# Project Overview

This project is designed to facilitate the development and testing of a web application using a MongoDB database. It includes scripts for database initialization and seeding test data, as well as a Docker setup for containerized deployment.

## Project Structure

- **scripts/**: Contains utility scripts for database management.
  - **init-db.js**: Initializes the MongoDB database with necessary collections and indexes.
  - **seed-data.js**: Generates and populates the database with sample test data.

- **docker-compose.yml**: Defines the services, networks, and volumes for running the application in a Docker environment.

- **.env**: Contains environment variables, including sensitive information like database connection strings and API keys.

- **README.md**: Documentation for the project, including setup instructions and usage guidelines.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git, such as `node_modules`, logs, and environment files.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>

   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables. Refer to the example provided in the `.env.example` file if available.

4. **Initialize the database**:
   Run the following command to initialize the MongoDB database:
   ```
   node scripts/init-db.js
   ```

5. **Seed the database with test data**:
   Populate the database with sample records by running:
   ```
   node scripts/seed-data.js
   ```

6. **Run the application using Docker**:
   Start the application with Docker by executing:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

## Usage Guidelines

- Access the application at `http://localhost:PORT` (replace `PORT` with the port specified in your `docker-compose.yml`).
